                <h1>Are Bees Important?</h1>
                    <p>Many domestic and imported fruits and vegetables require pollination.
                         Examples include avocados, soybeans, asparagus, broccoli, celery, squash, and 
                         sunflowers for oil, cucumbers, citrus fruit, peaches, kiwis, cherries, cranberries 
                         and melons. For crops such as blueberries and almonds, the honey bee plays 
                         an essential role in pollination of commercial crops,  with around 80% of the 
                         US crop said to be dependent on honey bees. Honey bees can also pollinate clover
                          and alfalfa, which are fed to cattle, so there are implications for the meat and 
                          dairy industry too. And that is not to mention the huge range of manufactured food
                           products made from all these ingredients.</p>

                <h1>Bees and the economy</h1>
                    <p>In 2008, the British Bee Keepers Association estimates that honey bees make a significant contribution to the £165 million annually generated for the UK economy through pollination by insects, with the figure put at £200 million in 2009 by the UK’s Public Accounts Committee. Many flowering food crops in the UK rely on honey bees for this service, for example: apples, pears, field beans, runner and dwarf beans, broad beans, strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, blackberries and oil seed rape,  with 39 commercial crops reliant on bees in total. Even if a crop is not directly pollinated by a honey bee, the crop still benefits indirectly from being in an environment in which honey bees are working, due to the increased biodiversity in the area which stimulates the crop.</p>

                <h1>The humble bumble</h1>
                    <p>The bumble bee is also used commercially in the UK as a pollinator of food crops,
                         in particular for tomatoes and soft fruits such as strawberries. Due to their size, 
                         shape and ability to vibrate vigorously they are more effective at pollinating certain crops.
                          In the UK we have 25 native species of bumble bee. This may seem like a healthy number
                           but unfortunately three species are already extinct, two are critically endangered and
                            many more are seriously declining in numbers. <br><br> Click the button below to check
