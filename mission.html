                    <h1>What’s Killing the Bees — and Why It Matters</h1>
                        <p>Worldwide bee colony collapse is not as big a mystery as the chemical industry claims.    
                            The systemic nature of the problem makes it complex, but not impenetrable.
                            Scientists know that bees are dying from a variety of factors—pesticides,
                            drought, habitat destruction, nutrition deficit, air pollution, global warming 
                            and more. Many of these causes are interrelated. The bottom line is that we know 
                            humans are largely responsible for the two most prominent causes: pesticides and 
                            habitat loss. Worker bees (females) live about six weeks in summer and several 
                            months in the winter. Colonies produce new worker bees continuously during the 
                            spring and summer, and then reproduction slows during the winter. Typically, a 
                            bee hive or colony will decline by 5-10 percent over the winter, and replace those
                            lost bees in the spring. In a bad year, a bee colony might lose 15-20 percent of 
                            its bees. In the U.S., winter losses have commonly reached 30-50 percent, in some
                            cases more. In 2006, David Hackenberg — a bee keeper for 42 years — reported a 90 
                            percent die-off among his 3,000 hives. U.S. National Agricultural Statistics show 
                            a honey bee decline from about 6 million hives in 1947 to 2.4 million hives in 2008,
                            a 60 percent reduction. The number of working bee colonies per hectare
                            provides a critical metric of crop health. In the U.S. — among crops that
                            require bee pollination — the number of bee colonies per hectare has
                            declined by 90 percent since 1962. The bees cannot keep pace with the
                            winter die-off rates and habitat loss.</p>

                    <h1>Pesticides and Bees</h1>
                        <p>Biologists have found more than 150 different chemical residues in bee pollen, a deadly “pesticide cocktail” 
                            according to University of California apiculturist Eric Mussen. The chemical companies Bayer, Syngenta, BASF, Dow, DuPont 
                            and Monsanto shrug their shoulders at the systemic complexity, as if the mystery were too complicated. They advocate no change
                            in pesticide policy. After all, selling poisons to the world’s farmers is profitable. Furthermore, wild bee habitat shrinks
                            every year as industrial agribusiness converts grasslands and forest into mono-culture farms, which are then contaminated
                            with pesticides. To reverse the world bee decline, we need to fix our dysfunctional and destructive agricultural system.</p>
